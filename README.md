# COVID-19-Neural-Network-Classifier
Chest x-rays of COVID-19 positive and negative patients were used to build a neural network classifier that can predict the chance of a patient having COVID-19

The positive cases are of patients diagonised with COVID. The negative cases are patients detected with either other forms of infection or no infections at all.

TensorFlow was utilized to build the Neural Network and process the images.
